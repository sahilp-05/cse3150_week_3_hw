# cse3150_week_3_hw

I used pointers to handle arrays of names and GPAs because the size is set when 
the program starts. I used const to make sure some values are not changed by 
accident. References help pass variables into functions without making extra 
copies. I also used casting when converting input from strings to numbers. 
Exceptions are used to handle errors like invalid input or trying to add a 
student when the list is full. The menu uses a loop and switch statements to 
let the user choose what to do, and if statements check for things like valid 
indexes or GPA values.
